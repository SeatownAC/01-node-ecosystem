Re: greet.js

greet.js takes in user input and if it's a string (valid) then it returns a heelo with the string the user inputed, if it's not a string, then it returns null.

Re: arithmetic.js

There are two methods that arithmetic.js uses, adding and subtracting. For both, as long as two numbers are passed in (if not a number, throws a message to user of 'not a number'), then the math is performed between the two numbers. You will end up with either a sum or remainder. I added in a test specifically for boolean input as well (to throw an error), just because I wanted more practice.
